# Mesh Reader

This Go Module is a helper for reading GDTF Model meshes.

It also contains special primitive models from the [MVR/GDTF Spec](https://github.com/mvrdevelopment/spec).

Parsing of 3DS files is heavily inspired by [fauxgl](https://github.com/fogleman/fauxgl).
This includes some helper funcs for math operations.
